1). Dr. Mehlhase really enjoys to torture her students by assigning difficult problems and instructing them to figure out complex questions which the students often see as 'mental torture' but in reality it just prepares them for the future work environment. 
2). Many students like to bottle up these emotions and sometimes they just come pouring out after the first bite of a perfectly cooked bratwurst straight from the grill. 
3). Only to find out that the bratwurst wasn't enough for their pain and torture, so they replan their strategy and a bright biergarten lightens up in the distance where their eyes glared. 
4). In addition, a yummy Gebaeck doesn't hurt to lighten the pain of working with Git commands.
5). The goal remains the same; finish the degree, get a remote developing job where you can work from your very own Schloss and no one can tell you that, "Lederhosen is not appropriate for the workplace" any more.
6). And buy your dream BMW i8 with those Software Engineer salary.
7). To accomplish this you must resist the desire to give up, move back in with your mother, and run a baeckerei out of her garage.
8). After all, the only thing your mother deserves from you in her garage is a Porsche. For putting up with years of hearing at every family dinner that you're so busy with school work and have no social life or a girlfriend.
9). Only to look back and remember that one place where it all started, that Dr. Mehlhase game was just to make us wettbewebsfaehig without knowing it. 
10). In the end you can always travel to Berlin to take some steam off and relax.
11). Then go back to school again and work like a hund. 
12). All the while fighting of sleep with a mixture of energy drinks and the blaring sound of Rammstein.
